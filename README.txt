Homework 4: Projections

Instructions: Use m or M to change the mode. In Orthogonal and Perspective modes, the viewing angles can be changed with the arrow keys, the field of view can be changes with + and -, and dim can be changed with page up and page down. In the First Person mode, the arrow keys change the viewing angle, and page up move the eye position forward while page down moves the eye position backwards. For some reason, certain views will not display even though I use the Cos and Sin macros to avoid 0 values in that regard. It also jumps sometimes when switching between changing the x angle and the y angle. 

Borrowed Code: I used a good bit of ex9 for the orthogonal and perspective modes. For the first person mode, I had a bit of trouble finding an intuitive way of doing it and ended up using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13862246/opengl-fps-camera-using-glulookat as a resource. I initially tried modifying the eye position and look position manually which was fine, but non intuitive and clunky. Even so the first person mode is janky, and I ran out of time to debug it.

Time to Complete: 2 hours to modify hw3 to fit orthogonal and perspective modes, then mostly some clean up. 3 hours spent trying to figure out first person, an hour spent looking through examples on the internet. 1 hour spent implementing a FPS camera solution. Total: 7 hours.
